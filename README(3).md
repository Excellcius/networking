# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I've developed a basic chat application utilizing a client-server model in Python. This application allows two computers to communicate through a server using Python's socket library and the TCP protocol. Initially, the system features a command-line interface for sending and receiving messages.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}



# Network Communication

Architecture: Client-Server
Protocol: TCP
Message Format: Text-based messages relayed through the server to facilitate communication between clients.

# Development Environment
Tools: Python programming language and its built-in socket library.

This initial version aims to establish fundamental communication capabilities between a single client and the server. Future enhancements could include managing multiple clients, implementing user authentication, adding message formatting for clarity, and transitioning from a command-line interface to a graphical user interface (GUI). The development direction might evolve based on learning experiences and potential additional functionalities discovered during the process.
